# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
This project will use the weather description data I retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers will use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Google Maps Directions API is used to create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
